# Netflix-EDA ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¥
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset presents a structured approach to understanding and analyzing the provided data. Here's a general summary of the steps involved:

1. Importing the Dataset: The analysis begins with importing the Netflix dataset using a suitable library like pandas.

2. Initial Data Exploration: The dataset is explored initially to gain a basic understanding. This includes:
Displaying the first few and last few rows of the dataset.
Checking the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the dataset.
Exploring column names, data types, and basic statistical properties of numerical columns.

3. Data Cleaning:
Identifying and removing duplicate records, if any.
Visualizing null values using techniques like heatmaps to identify missing data.

4. Question & Answer Section (QA):
Answering specific questions about the dataset using filtering techniques.
Extracting relevant information based on specific conditions.
Conducting statistical analysis to derive insights from the data.

5. Visualizations:
Creating visual representations such as bar graphs, count plots, and heatmaps to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
Visualizing categorical and numerical data to identify patterns and trends.

6. Summary and Insights:
Summarizing key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
Providing interpretations and conclusions based on the observations made during the exploration.

Overall, the EDA process aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset, providing valuable insights for further analysis or decision-making.
